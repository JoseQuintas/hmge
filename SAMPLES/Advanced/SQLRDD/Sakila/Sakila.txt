The Sakila database is a nicely normalised database modelling a DVD rental store
(for those of you old enough to remember what that is).

Its design includes a few nice features:

* Many to many relationships
* Multiple paths between entities 
  (e.g. film-inventory-rental-payment vs film-inventory-store-customer-payment) to practice joins
* Consistent naming of columns
  + Primary keys are called [tablename]_[id]
  + Foreign keys are called like their referenced primary key, if possible. 
    This allows for using JOIN .. USING syntax where supported
  + Relationship tables do not have any surrogate keys but use composite primary keys
  + Every table has a last_update audit column
  + A generated data set of a reasonable size is available
