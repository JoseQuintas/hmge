This program was born out of a need of mine.
From the tests carried out I found that the function hb_FSetDateTime()
it doesn't change all the dates, so I decided to force the replacement
applying a new complete C code for date manipulation.
A special thank to Daniele Federico for his ideas during the planning phase.
